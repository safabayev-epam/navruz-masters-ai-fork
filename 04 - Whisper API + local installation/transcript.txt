 and get the result, but it's super hard to understand what are the integers you multiply if you receive this result. A lot of encryption is based on that, and actually Bitcoin is based on that. Bitcoin has a lot of protocols inside, like technologies, which you send, most of them are top tier encryption we have right now. If Google can beat that, they can possibly hijack all the new Bitcoins. Maybe they can rewrite the whole blockchain in a day, and steal all the Bitcoins from us. A lot of military applications, like all this encryption and networking. It's technically possible that the SASH technology can appear, but taking an account how much time and money and resources and smart people it takes to build SASH think. Maybe the first country which builds it, will create some kind of like snow crash, like from Cyberpunk books, I don't know, so we'll see. At least I know from what I understand, like IT history and technology history, all the new top tier technologies, they have two applications, like the two industries, basically driving them fast, making them broadly available, is porn industry and military. So this is like two things, usually picking up the latest SASH and trying to get money of that.
